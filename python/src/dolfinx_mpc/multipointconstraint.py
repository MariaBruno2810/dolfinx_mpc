    Hold data for multi point constraint relation ships,

    The constraint is affine, :math:`x = K x_{red} + g`, where :math:`g` is
    supplied through `rhs_coeffs` and through the Dirichlet conditions in
    `bcs`. With neither, :math:`g=0` and the constraint is the usual linear
    one.

            constraint. Defaults to the default scalar type of DOLFINx, real or complex, at the
            precision of the mesh of `V`. Its precision must be that of the mesh.
        bcs: Dirichlet boundary conditions for the problem. A master degree of
            freedom that is constrained by one of these is removed from the
            equation of its slave, and its contribution folded into the
            constraint offset :math:`g`. As the offset is recomputed from the
            current values of the conditions by :func:`update_constants`, time
            dependent boundary data is supported.

        A row is the equation :math:`u_s = \sum_j c_j u_{m_j}` of its slave :math:`u_s`, whichever

        A call adds one term per slave. Further terms of the same slave are added by further calls,
